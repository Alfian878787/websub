# pubsubhubbub

PuSH Spec in Social Web Working Group.
The current spec is being imported from https://github.com/pubsubhubbub/pubsubhubbub

The goal is to make the spec W3C-ready.

A couple changes will be required including:

* better specification around diffing mechanisms
* address feedback from the indieweb community
