# Implementation Reports

This folder is where you can find implementation reports that have been submitted.

To submit your own implementation report, copy the appropriate template file to a new `.md` file with the name of your implementation, and check the boxes for any features that your implementation supports.

Implementation report templates are available for publishers, subscribers, and hubs.

* `SUBSCRIBER-TEMPLATE.md`
* `PUBLISHER-TEMPLATE.md` (in progress)
* `HUB-TEMPLATE.md` (in progress)
